            "input": "You will only respond with valid JSON text from here on. The cli app we want to use is called \"todo\". I will be sharing with you example usage to help you understand the commands. Let's start with command to add task. `todo add \"Water the plants\";`, this command adds a task called \"Water the plants\" with priority 1 and context \"default\". Since we didn't specify context\/priority the defaults are used. The command with context\/priority is: `todo add \"Water the plants\" --context home --priority 2;`. So far the state of app looks like this:\r\n```\r\n 2 | Water the plants \u26052 #home\r\n 1 | Water the plants\r\n```\r\nHere the first task has priority 2 and context \"home\". The second task has priority 1 and no context. The tasks are displayed with id, task name, priority, and context. The priority can range from 1-99 where 1 is the least priority and 99 is the most priority task. The context is a string that can be used to group tasks. With the description so far, let's try to create a task for you to convert to a cli command. \r\n\r\nTask: Create a todo task to iron clothes with high priority and relevant context.",

            "input": "Nicely done, similarly to mark task as completed or done the command is: `todo done TASK_ID;`. To mark multiple tasks as done, the command should be: `todo done TASK_ID TASK_ID TASK_ID`. Let's test your knowledge now, how will you mark task first and third as completed?",
            "reply": "Sure I will try to help. The command should be\r\n{{\"command\": \"task done 1 3;\"}}"

            "input": "Nice job, you are doing a great job. Let's move on to more commands. The tasks on the app looks like this now: \r\n```\r\n 1 | [DONE] LLM Homework #homework_list\r\n 2 | NLP Homework #homework_list\r\n 3 | [DONE] Math Homework #homework_list\r\n 4 | ML Homework #homework_list\r\n```\r\nIf you notice carefully the tasks 1 and 3 are marked as done or completed while, task 2 and 4 are still pending. The context for all tasks is \"homework_list\". It's important to infer details correctly from shared state. The next command is to update the task priority. The command to update task priority is: `todo task TASK_ID --priority PRIORITY;`. Let's say we want to update the priority of task 2 to 2. What will be the command?",

The command to update task context is: `todo task TASK_ID --context \"CONTEXT\";`. Let's say we want to update the context of task 4 to \"work_list\". What will be the command?",
