cmd: todo --flat
desc: returns flat list already existing todo tasks
res:
 3 | ML Project #project_list
 4 | Algebra I Project #archive_list

example cli app usage:
```
## Basic usage

Add a task to do using the `add` command:

	todo add "Do the thing"

See what you have to do by passing no option:

	todo
	  1 | Do the thing

The tasks shown first are the ones you entered first:

	todo add "Fix the stuff"
	todo
	  1 | Do the thing
	  2 | Fix the stuff

Set a task as done using the `done` command, with the task's ID as value:

	todo done 1
	todo
	  2 | Fix the stuff

ℹ️ If you want to cancel the task being done, you can use the `undone` command.


## Priority

You can assign a priority to a task using the `-p` or `--priority` option. Priorities are integers; the higher the integer, the higher the priority. Tasks with a higher priority are shown first. By default, tasks have a priority of 1.

	todo add "Fix the window" -p 3
	todo
	  6 | Fix the window ★3
	  4 | Send the documents for the house ⌛ 6 days remaining
	  3 | Buy the gift for Stefany ⌛ 16 days remaining
	  2 | Fix the stuff
	todo task 2 -p 2
	todo
	  6 | Fix the window ★3
	  2 | Fix the stuff ★2
	  4 | Send the documents for the house ⌛ 6 days remaining
	  3 | Buy the gift for Stefany ⌛ 16 days remaining

```

Task:
Move all completed tasks from my project_list to an archive_list

## Strictly Important ##
1. Do not include anything in your output other than the command to execute.
2. The total output text should be 1 line.

## Hints ##
1. Use task ids separated by space.
